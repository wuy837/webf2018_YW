			<p>I get the idea from a movie called Laputa: Castle in the Sky by Hayao Miyazaki. I want to create Chinese towers floating above the mountains in the sky. I choose Yuejiang Tower in Nanjing where I grow up, Beijing's Forbidden City and Mount Huangshan in Anhui where I born as my references. At the beginning, my sketch was one-point perspective. It was hard to tell the towers are floating in the sky. I changed it to two-point perspective and one tower is further away. However, the horizontal line is not very clear. I should improve it. I draw the towers and mountains in black and white first because I want to make sure the structure is correct. Then, I add a new layer to put the colors on. I choose red, green and yellow for towers because they are the three main colors of old Chinese buildings. I keep the background in white and light blue in order to create contrast with towers and mountains and help the towers pop out. I should mix more dark neutral shades. I do not have varieties of color on my work.</p>
